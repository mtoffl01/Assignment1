	<h1> Mikayla Toffler's Biography </h1>
	<p> Hi! I am a senior at Tufts University with a major in Cognitive and
		Brain Sciences and a minor in Computer Science. I am from NYC and although
		I most certainly do not yet have a job lined up post-graduation, I know
		without a doubt I will be moving back to NY after college finishes. I
		have a golden retriever named Willie and although he's very old now I 
		will forever love him like a puppy. I have no siblings so I am very close
		with my parents and my friends. I enjoy coffee, yoga, biking, writing 
	and music. </p>
