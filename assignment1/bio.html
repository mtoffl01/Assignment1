	<h1> Mikayla Toffler's Biography </h1>
	<p> Hi! I am from NYC and I'm currently a senior at Tufts University. I have
		a major in Cognitive and Brain Sciences and a minor in Computer Science. 
		I totally do not yet have a job lined up post-graduation, but I know
		without a doubt I'll be moving back to NY when college finishes. I
		have a Golden Retriever named Willie, and although he's very old now he
		still acts like a puppy. I enjoy coffee, yoga, biking, writing and music.
		Oh and coding.
