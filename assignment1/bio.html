	<p> It wasn’t until sophomore year of college that I discovered my passion for programming. I’d spent the years prior disparaging computer science for being too nerdy, “not for me!” But then my Cognitive and Brain Sciences major mandated that I take three computer science courses, and although this task appeared viciously impossible, I had no choice but to do it. </p>
	<p>Oh man, didn’t I know what I was getting myself into. More hours, more energy, and more stressed and frenzied late, late  nights than I have spent on any other department’s homework—programming ensnared me right off the bat. With my music jamming, programming allowed me to watch my awesome work unfold in real time. “Clang++ -Wall -Wextra ./a.out”, and bing!  Completing my first program made me feel powerful. </p>
	<p>By graduation, I will have taken a total of seven computer science courses. I have a strong foundation in C++ which I gained in my first two introductory programming classes. I then took three computer-science-related math and theory courses in which I learned about the theoretical foundations of computer science, analyzing time and space complexity, and all about algorithms. I took a class on Artificial Intelligence which exposed me to smart algorithms and some Python. In my current and final semester I’m taking a Web Programming class, which is teaching me all about HTML/CSS and Javascript (and I am  really  enjoying it!). </p>
	<p>I am a strong leader, an eager student, and a kind and gregarious person. I apply my 100% to any given task, and I know I can learn any and all skills required of me, if I put my mind to it. I have a passion for creative projects, social issues, and community building. Thanks for taking the time to get to know me!
