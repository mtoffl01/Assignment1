	<h1> Mikayla Toffler's Biography </h1>
	<p> Hi! I am a senior at Tufts University originally from NYC. I major in
		Cognitive and Brain Sciences and minor in Computer Science. I have a 
		Golden Retriever named Willie, and although he's very old now he
		still acts like a puppy. I enjoy coffee, yoga, biking, writing and music.
		Oh--and coding.
